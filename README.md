:octocat: Github profile app :octocat:
=================

This the tutorial from week 7 at Makers Academy. The project was to create a simple Github Profile app purely in JavaScript that grabs data from the Github API in order to display a specified users avatar, number of followers and number of repos.

The project involved using JavaScript to consume data available from third parties over the network (e.g. Github API data accessed via Ajax) and using more advanced JavaScript Model View Controller (MVC) frameworks such as AngularJS.
